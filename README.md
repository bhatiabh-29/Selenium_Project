INFO6255 Selenium Project:
Requirements:
1. Use Maven as your project and add dependency in your pom.xml.
2. Take screenshots before and after every step is successfully executed and save them in a folder with
the scenario name.
3. After a scenario is executed next scenario is run automatically without manual intervention.
4. You can use Java or Python as a programming language.
5. Add correct Assertions wherever required.
6. Create an HTML report of the scenarios with the following columns:
• Test scenario name
• Actual
• Expected
• Pass/Fail
Note:
1) The HTML report is one way of generating a report, if you can think of something else you can
implement it.
2) Regarding two-factor authentication. YOU CAN hit the enter key once manually during your
session for the two-factor authentication, that will be OK. Other than that, no other manual
intervention will be acceptable.
Team Presentations:
1. You should upload one copy of your script to the Assignment on Canvas before the class.
2. Each group will be called randomly to present their Selenium script.
3. Your presentation should not be more than 10 minutes long.
4. Select one representative from your group that will demo the script in the class.
5. Your script should run seamlessly without any interruptions or manual intervention during the
presentation. (Note: hitting the enter key once manually for the 2-factor authentication is the
only exception!!!!).
6. Practice good coding techniques (Appropriate comments in the code).
7. Use a data sheet or a different Class for any data needed in your code. No hard-coded values.
8. All the group members must directly participate in the presentation and be ready to answer any
questions.
